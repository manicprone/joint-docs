# Joint Kit Docs Planning


## Backlog

* Create diagram(s) to describe the concepts / where Joint fits in the application stack.

* Remove "The Joint Concept" guide => instead, just describe the concept in the Overview section.

* Put prev / next navigation links between the sections, to make the full doc navigable.
