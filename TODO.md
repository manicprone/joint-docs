# Joint Docs Planning


## Backlog

* Make all headings in About and Guides linkable (to the root topic),
  just like the API section.

* Add a simple "About" that mentions the starting paragraphs in the "Joint in Practice"
  section... remove from "Joint in Practice" to keep it lean.

* Put prev / next navigation links between the sections, to make the full doc
  navigable.
