<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The Joint Kit is a server-side development library for building data layers
  within your Node application.
</p>

<p>
  Use the Joint Kit to quickly:
</p>

{% call text.framedblock(maxWidth='340px') -%}
<ul class="definition">
  <li>
    <div>connect your Node app to persisted data</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>build server-side method libraries</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>build RESTful APIs for client apps</div>
  </li>
</ul>
{%- endcall %}

<br />

<callout>
  The solution sits on top of your database service/ORM
  (to provide custom data logic), and behind your server framework
  (to provide custom http middleware logic).
</callout>

<br />

<p>
  Here&#39;s where the Joint Kit fits into your application:

<h3>Quick to Implement</h3>

<p>
  At its core, the Joint Kit is a data operations library.

  <lilp>
  It exposes a set of abstract data actions (as JavaScript functions)
  that can be hooked to your custom data schema.
  </lilp>

  <lilp>
  The redundant, tedious logic behind each data action (the majority of the work)
  is already handled for you... you just need to define the concrete behavior
  for your application, using configrable JSON objects.
  </lilp>
</p>

<h3>Configuration-Driven</h3>

<p>
  Nearly the entire solution can be defined using a configuration syntax (JSON),
  leaving the programming logic to an extreme minimum.

  <lilp>
  With this approach, your custom data layers are dynamically generated on
  application startup.
  </lilp>

  <lilp>
  Configurations can therefore be hot-swapped, to load variations based upon
  application environment, etc.
  </lilp>
</p>

<h3>Programmatically Flexible</h3>

<p>
  If you want more complexity, integration, and control...
  you can leverage the library as a purely programmatic solution.

  <lilp>
  Let the Joint Kit handle the generic aspects of your data operations (the 80%),
  while you supplement the implementation with your own hand-rolled logic (the 20%).
  </lilp>
</p>

<h3>Isolated Services</h3>

<p>
  You can create multiple instances from the Kit (referred to as <i>Joints</i>)
  within a single application; each isolated to service separate data
  repositories, schemas, and implementation behavior.

  <lilp>
  You can also mix-and-match both implementation methods (configuration and programmatic)
  within the same Joint instance.
  </lilp>
