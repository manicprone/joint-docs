<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The Joint Kit is a flexible development library for:
</p>

<ul class="definition">
  <li>
    <div>connecting your Node application to a new or existing database schema</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>building a server-side method library</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>building a RESTful API for client applications</div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here&#39;s where the Joint Kit fits into your application:

</p>

<p>
  The implementation can be performed with a configuration syntax (in JSON),
  leaving the programming logic to an extreme minimum.
</p>

<p>
  Or, you can leverage the library as a programmatic solution, granting the
  flexibility to augment the out-of-the-box features with your own specialized logic.
</p>

<p>
  The Joint Kit solution is abstracted away from its underlying implementation layers.
</p>

<p>
  So, you can switch out the database vendor, the ORM service layer, and the server
  framework... and the configuration and coded logic will not require any changes.
