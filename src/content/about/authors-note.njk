<h2>Author&#39;s Note</h2>

<p>
  The Joint Kit was conceived, so that I could quickly spin up new server-side
  applications and RESTful APIs.
</p>

<p>
  I found other similar solutions to either be too rigid, with respect to the
  database schema requirements, or too overarching, offering to automatically
  generate a "complete" solution for my desired functionality.
</p>

<p>
  I simply wanted to eliminate writing the same foundation data logic over and over,
  but maintain the freedom to mix-in custom code, at any point, in order to support
  the nuances of application variance and complexity.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, I wanted to have the logic of my HTTP API reflected as a full
  method library, to support isomorphic scenarios (where the server-side can access
  native data objects via functions, while the client-side can access serialized data
  payloads via HTTP).
</p>

<p>
  The Joint Kit package is public, to demonstrate who I am, and what I do.
</p>

<p>
  You are absolutely free to use it, fork it, criticize it. But, I do not have plans to accept PRs
  or otherwise prioritize code issues/enhancements on any form of intuitive metric.
  But, I do keep a <code>TODO.md</code> file at the root of the repository, to broadcast
  what is in the development roadmap.
